# HTC Grid Contributing Guidelines and Governance Policies

This document describes the contribution process and governance policies of the FINOS {project name} project. The project is also governed by the [Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/), and the FINOS [IP Policy]( https://community.finos.org/governance-docs/IP-policy.pdf), [Code of Conduct](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/code-of-conduct), [Collaborative Principles](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/collaborative-principles/), and [Meeting Procedures](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/meeting-procedures/).

## Contribution Process

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

NOTE: All contributors must have a contributor license agreement (CLA) on file with FINOS before their pull requests will be merged. Please review the FINOS [contribution requirements](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution-compliance-requirements) and submit (or have your employer submit) the required CLA before submitting a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.


## Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq) or contact
opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional questions or comments.


## Security issue notifications
If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/). Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.

## Governance

### Roles

The project community consists of Contributors and Maintainers:
* A **Contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. (Contributions may include code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.)
* A **Maintainer** is a Contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given write access to project repositories and may merge approved contributions.
* The **Lead Maintainer** is the project's interface with the FINOS team and Board. They are responsible for approving [quarterly project reports](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#project-governing-board-reporting) and communicating on behalf of the project. The Lead Maintainer is elected by a vote of the Maintainers. 

### Contribution Rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a contribution to the project. The rules below apply to all contributions. (The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc. in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).)

* All contributions MUST be submitted as pull requests, including contributions by Maintainers.
* All pull requests SHOULD be reviewed by a Maintainer (other than the Contributor) before being merged.
* Pull requests for non-trivial contributions SHOULD remain open for a review period sufficient to give all Maintainers a sufficient opportunity to review and comment on them.
* After the review period, if no Maintainer has an objection to the pull request, any Maintainer MAY merge it.
* If any Maintainer objects to a pull request, the Maintainers SHOULD try to come to consensus through discussion. If not consensus can be reached, any Maintainer MAY call for a vote on the contribution.

### Maintainer Voting

The Maintainers MAY hold votes only when they are unable to reach consensus on an issue. Any Maintainer MAY call a vote on a contested issue, after which Maintainers SHALL have 36 hours to register their votes. Votes SHALL take the form of "+1" (agree), "-1" (disagree), "+0" (abstain). Issues SHALL be decided by the majority of votes cast. If there is only one Maintainer, they SHALL decide any issue otherwise requiring a Maintainer vote. If a vote is tied, the Lead Maintainer MAY cast an additional tie-breaker vote.

The Maintainers SHALL decide the following matters by consensus or, if necessary, a vote:
* Contested pull requests
* Election and removal of the Lead Maintainer
* Election and removal of Maintainers

All Maintainer votes MUST be carried out transparently, with all discussion and voting occurring in public, either:
* in comments associated with the relevant issue or pull request, if applicable;
* on the project mailing list or other official public communication channel; or
* during a regular, minuted project meeting.

### Maintainer Qualifications

Any Contributor who has made a substantial contribution to the project MAY apply (or be nominated) to become a Maintainer. The existing Maintainers SHALL decide whether to approve the nomination according to the Maintainer Voting process above.

### Changes to this Document

This document MAY be amended by a vote of the Maintainers according to the Maintainer Voting process above.
